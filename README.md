CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) Tests.
OpenAI's CLIP efficiently learns visual concepts from natural language supervision. CLIP can be applied to any visual classification benchmark by simply providing the names of the visual categories to be recognized, similar to the “zero-shot” capabilities of GPT-2 and GPT-3.  CLIP is a part of the DALL-E 2 Language to Image model.
